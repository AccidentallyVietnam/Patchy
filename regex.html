                <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
                <p>Patchy supports adding torrents based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular
                expressions</a> in RSS feeds. These are powerful expressions that allow you to be quite specific with which
                torrents are added and which are discarded. It is suggested that you spend some time reading about them on
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Wikipedia</a>, or through other sources, but here's
                a really simple crash course:</p>
                <p>Say you want to add new episodes of the TV show "foo bar" as they're released. You know the torrent name
                will be something like "Foo Bar S01E<strong>#</strong>". The following regex would match it:</p>
                <pre>Foo Bar S01E[0-9]+</pre>
                <p>This looks for "Foo Bar SE01E", and then at least one character between 0 and 9 (<code>[0-9]+</code>).</p>
                <p>Another example: you want the latest album by "That One Group". You know the torrent will be named something
                like "That One Group - <strong>Album Name</strong>". You could use this regex:</p>
                <pre>That One Group - [A-Z ]+</pre>
                <p>This will match on "That One Group - ", and then at least one letter or space (<code>[A-Z ]+</code>).</p>
                <p>If you're in doubt, regex will also match most normal text. So, "Foo Bar" would match anything with
                "Foo Bar" in the title. There are a few special characters you cannot use - see the Wikipedia page. You can
                still use these characters if you escape them, like this: "\."</p>
                <p>Notes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patch regexes are not case-sensitive</li>
                    <li>^ and $ are not added automatically</li>
                </ul>
