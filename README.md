## Why should I use it?

*Note: Patchy is currently a work in progress, and to use it now would be silly. Treat this section as
"why should I use it when it's done"*

Patchy is free and open source. Most Windows clients these days have become adware with premium versions
and other similar saddening things. Patchy will never be like this - no ads, no extra software in the
installer, and it comes with all the features, completely free.

## Download

Make sure you come back to get updates until auto-updating is added.
